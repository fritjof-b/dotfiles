# Dotfiles

For my own sanity, I'm keeping my dotfiles in this repo.
I'm using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the symlinks.

There are also general steps for setting up a new machine (MacOS).

## Setup

1. Install command line tools: `xcode-select --install`
2. Run `./NO-STOW/setup.sh` to install Homebrew and other tools

## MacOS

### Settings

- `Trackpad > Tap to click`
- `Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast`
- `Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short`
- `Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Function Keys > Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys`
- `Keyboard > Text > Disable "Correct spelling automatically"`
