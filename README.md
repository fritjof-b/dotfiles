# dotfiles
Online storage for my dotfiles running Ubuntu 19.10 (prev. Debian 10 Buster).

I often look at [https://protesilaos.com/pdfd/] for ideas and help. If you want to run Debian 10 with BSPWM I highly recommend the Prot's Dots for Debian. Very thourogh, extensive and well-documented.

As of my own dotfiles they are a work in progress.
